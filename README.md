## Question 1 <a style="font-size:8pt;" href="#contents">[back to contents]</a>

Given that a typical HTML boiler plate is as such:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
    <link href="style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet">
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
      
      <script src="script.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Create a **single page** webpage that consists of a title, two subtitles and two paragraphs.

The title should say "Myself". The first subtitle should be "About Me" while the second should be "My Ambition". The paragraphs should contain information related to the Subtitles. The diagram below shows a rough example of how it would look.

## Question 2 <a style="font-size:8pt;" href="#contents">[back to contents]</a>

Create a **single page** webpage that would reflect on how a recipe guide would look like.

The recipe guide would have the following:

1. Title of the recipe
2. Summary of the recipe
3. Ingredients needed
4. The steps of the recipe

The main title should be larger than the subtitles. Ingredients and steps of the recipes **must be in the proper list formats**.

## Question 3 <a style="font-size:8pt;" href="#contents">[back to contents]</a>

Based on question 2, create another **single page** webpage that is exactly as you've done in question 2. However this time around, each section (summary, ingredients and steps) would have a different background color and different colored texts.

The choice of colors are to your discretion. 

Additionally, add anywhere in the page that says "&copy;Â Copyright of the Eat & Eat Corps. 2020"
